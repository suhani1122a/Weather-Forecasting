# Weather-Forecasting
This project is dedicated to developing a weather
forecasting system using machine learning techniques in the Python
programming environment. Weather forecasting plays an integral
role in modern life, affecting everything from agriculture and
transportation to disaster preparedness. The project went through
several important phases. In the initial stage, historical
meteorological data is collected from reliable sources, including
various weather parameters, including geographic data. This data
set forms the basis for building a robust predictive model.
